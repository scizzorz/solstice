# Solstice

A board game

## Rules

### Objective

End the game with the most pieces _face up._

### Setup

For two players: play with a 3x3 board and deal 9 pieces to each player.

For three players: play with a 4x4 board and deal 8 pieces to each player.

For four players: play with a 5x5 board and deal 7 pieces to each player.

Deal an extra piece to the first player.

### Game Play

Players take turns placing a piece from their hand onto an empty space on the board.

_Note: on the first turn, players may not play their piece adjacent to another piece._

The game ends when there's a single empty space.

When placed, the symbols in each direction perform an action:

* a single dot will flip the adjacent neighbor in its direction
* a solid line will shield the piece from being flipped in its direction
* a double dot in one direction allows two options:
  * _shield break_ a piece, causing it to flip even if it's shielded
  * _pierce_ through two pieces in its direction, flipping both unless shielded

The 4-pointed star piece behaves uniquely: playing it allows you to swap with any face up piece on
the board. The newly placed star piece will still belong to the original owner of the swapped piece.

_Note: on the first turn, players may not play the star piece._

Players may flip pieces owned by any player, including themselves.

Face down pieces may be flipped back up.

### Pieces

The deck is composed of 32 unique pieces.

indicate a piece's "family").
